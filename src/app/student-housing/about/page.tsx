            Campus Capital is a portfolio project: a student-housing acquisitions screening platform built to
            look and behave like the desk of a commercial real-estate acquisitions analyst. It combines live university
            enrollment data, real apartment maps, news-driven demand signals, and a transparent acquisition score into one
            research tool, powered entirely by free, public data sources.
