 * Major public-market players with direct purpose-built student-housing
 * exposure.
 *
 * Purpose-built student housing has largely consolidated into private hands:
 * American Campus Communities was taken private by Blackstone in 2022 and
 * Education Realty Trust was acquired by Greystar in 2018, so the pure-play
 * public REITs no longer trade. This roster therefore blends the sector's
 * defining REIT with the institutional owners that have consolidated it and
 * the apartment REITs most concentrated in university metros.
 *
 * Every CIK below was verified against SEC EDGAR (data.sec.gov). The roster is
 * public reference fact; each firm's actual filing activity is pulled live from
 * EDGAR and headlines come live from Google News, so nothing here is fabricated.
 * Where a firm has gone private, its most recent filings are historical and the
 * displayed dates make that plain.
